# Developer Tools


For debugging purpose we have developped several tools/pages


### Import and validate a Yaml

If you have the Prof role, you can go to `/import/yaml` and will enjoy a simple tool to put your YAML in,
and perhaps import it into an existing test.

Input data are not displayed after validation, thus don't use that tool without having a copy of submited data.
