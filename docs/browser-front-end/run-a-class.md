# Run a class

Once the server is running, follow these instructions:

To run a class, you need to log in as a teacher and go on the url: /#/session/[Session name]/[Professor login]/tb

A student can join by logging in as a student and going on the url: /#/session/[Professor login]

To close the room, the teacher can go to the following url: /#/close_room/[Professor login]
(We lacked the time to polish navigation so these URL allow us to simply run a class without using the navigation)
