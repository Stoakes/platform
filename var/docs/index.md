#Launch the project

To use that project, you need to install
- [docker](https://docs.docker.com/engine/installation/)
- [docker-compose](https://docs.docker.com/compose/install/)
 

*Clone the project*

```bash
git clone https://github.com/projet-aaa/platform.git
cd platform
```

*Launch the project*

```bash
docker-compose up # add -d if you want to run it as a daemon
```

You can then go to http://localhost to test it.
